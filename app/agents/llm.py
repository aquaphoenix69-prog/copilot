"""
LLM Response generator using an OpenAI-compatible local server.

Works with both Ollama (default for Windows) and vLLM. The two share an
OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API at /v1/chat/completions, so the same
client code works for both — only base_url and model name change.

Inputs: State + PlannerSuggestion (or fallback path).
Output: a coaching suggestion the human agent can read on screen.

If the planner returns used_fallback=True (cold state), we skip the planner
guidance and ask the LLM to suggest a generic next move from the transcript.
